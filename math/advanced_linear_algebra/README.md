Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is a determinant? How would you calculate it?
What is a minor, cofactor, adjugate? How would calculate them?
What is an inverse? How would you calculate it?
What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors? How would you calculate them?
What is definiteness of a matrix? How would you determine a matrixâ€™s definiteness?
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.25.2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.11.1)
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
