Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is Keras?
What is a model?
How to instantiate a model (2 ways)
How to build a layer
How to add regularization to a layer
How to add dropout to a layer
How to add batch normalization
How to compile a model
How to optimize a model
How to fit a model
How to use validation data
How to perform early stopping
How to measure accuracy
How to evaluate a model
How to make a prediction with a model
How to access the weights/outputs of a model

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.25.2) and tensorflow (version 2.15)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.11.1)
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import tensorflow.keras as K
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
