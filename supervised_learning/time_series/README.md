What is a stationary process?
What is a sliding window?
How to preprocess time series data
How to create a data pipeline in tensorflow for time series data
How to perform time series forecasting with RNNs in tensorflow
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.25.2), tensorflow (version 2.15) and pandas (version 2.2.2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
All of your files must be executable
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should follow the pycodestyle style (version 2.11.1)
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
