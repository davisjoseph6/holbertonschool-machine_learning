## Directory Overview

### Normalization
1. **`0-norm_constants.py`**
   - Computes the mean and standard deviation of a dataset for normalization.

2. **`1-normalize.py`**
   - Normalizes a dataset using its mean and standard deviation.

### Data Preparation
3. **`2-shuffle_data.py`**
   - Shuffles the data points in two matrices (e.g., features and labels) consistently.

4. **`3-mini_batch.py`**
   - Creates mini-batches from input data for mini-batch gradient descent.

### Optimization Techniques
5. **`4-moving_average.py`**
   - Calculates the weighted moving average of a dataset with bias correction.

6. **`6-momentum.py`**
   - Implements the gradient descent with momentum optimization algorithm using TensorFlow's SGD optimizer.

7. **`8-RMSProp.py`**
   - Sets up the RMSProp optimization algorithm in TensorFlow for adaptive learning rates.

8. **`10-Adam.py`**
   - Configures the Adam optimization algorithm in TensorFlow for efficient training.

### Learning Rate Decay
9. **`12-learning_rate_decay.py`**
   - Implements inverse time decay for dynamically adjusting the learning rate during training.

### Batch Normalization
10. **`14-batch_norm.py`**
    - Creates a batch normalization layer in TensorFlow to standardize inputs to a layer during training.

## How to Use

### Preprocessing
- Use `0-norm_constants.py` and `1-normalize.py` to compute normalization constants and normalize datasets.
- Shuffle data using `2-shuffle_data.py` to ensure randomness before splitting into batches.

### Training
- Use `3-mini_batch.py` to generate mini-batches for training.
- Apply advanced optimization techniques like momentum (`6-momentum.py`), RMSProp (`8-RMSProp.py`), or Adam (`10-Adam.py`) for faster convergence.

### Fine-Tuning
- Employ learning rate decay (`12-learning_rate_decay.py`) for dynamically adjusting learning rates.
- Integrate batch normalization layers (`14-batch_norm.py`) to stabilize training and speed up convergence.
