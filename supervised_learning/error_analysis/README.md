Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.25.2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.11.1)
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import numpy as np
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
